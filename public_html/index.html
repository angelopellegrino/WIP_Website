            <p> Technology is one of the most significant
                aspects our society uses today and it has always been one of my
                interests. Whether it was working with software, exploring new
                technologies, or fixing and building computers; computer
                technology is something that I have always been passionate
                about. However there was one specific field that had
                cached my attention the most… software development. </p><br />
            
            <p> Software Development first caught my attention when
                I met a friend of my father’s named Al. Al had his own company
                named Total Computer Group where they developed software for
                law enforcement. I was fascinated by how he created his own
                program and was successful. This encounter eventually led to my
                passion for computers. I began to tinker with software at the
                age of 13 and by 14 I had created my very first game server for
                Counter Strike using a program known as SRCDS. SRCDS is a
                program where you essentially run a virtual battlefield from
                games based on Valve’s source engine. Not only did I have to
                make configurations and install modifications, but I also had
                to learn how to network, more specifically port forwarding.
                I became skilled enough that I was able to run 3 servers at once.
                Eventually I began to seek an education in computer science at
                LIU Post.
