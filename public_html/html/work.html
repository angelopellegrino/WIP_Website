                    I started a career in technology at the age of 15 under the
                    guidance of my father's friend Al. He had brought me aboard 
                    to his company Total Computer Group, where I was exposed to 
                    quality assurance. This was the first step in the foundation
                    of my work ethic. Quality assurance taught me many things.
                    For one, I learned how to look for problems and how to
                    report them. You had to take steps to break the program and 
                    potentially use it in ways that it was not designed for.
                    after you found a problem, it was important to document the 
                    steps taken to recreate the problem. At the time I had no
                    programming experience so there would be no actual debugging
                    done by me. In the end, I found well over 100 bugs.

                    My next major breakthrough was with the I.T. Department at
                    NIF Group Inc, where I was taken under their wing in the
                    summer of 2012. At first they had assigned me small tasks,
                    such as updating images on a website and working on excel
                    spreadsheets. Eventually they presented me with bigger
                    projects to handle. Their NYC office was moving into a new
                    building and I was given the task to find a new ISP and new 
                    networking equipment for the new location. Working at NIF
                    taught me that things needed to be completed with high
                    accuracy, and in an orderly and timely manner. Most
                    importantly I learned that documentation was key.
